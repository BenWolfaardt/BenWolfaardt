# `Cosmos SDK`

## Commercio

##### [GitHub](https://github.com/commercionetwork?type=source)

[Commercio.network](https://commercio.network/) has created the *Documents Blockchain*, an eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) Compliant Legally Binding Blockchain, that allows companies to effortlessly manage their business documents using the lates technology.

I've been working at Commercio for the past few months in the capacity of `Go` Blockchain Developer. 

> Here my tech stack includes: `Go`, `Protobuf`, `Docker`, `PostgreSQL`, Scripting & RESTfull APIs. 

In this role I:
* Create, maintain, test, and debug the chain in Go.
* This includes the core application logic, databases, data and application integration & RESTful web services / APIâ€™s.
* Write tickets and report bugs, make code improvement suggestions, review MRs, provide constructive feedback & write Unix scripts.

Currently we are upgrading our chain from `Cosmos SDK` version `0.39` to version `0.44`. This is quite a major upgrade as we're shifting to using Protobuf for everything as to further improve the efficiencies in our system. Although Commercio is an [open source project](https://github.com/commercionetwork/commercionetwork) it still interacts with many proprietary systems. These systesms are used to make interacting with our Blockchain more easy by making use of a `Go` backend, API services and a `JS` frontend. My role at Commercio also includes the maintenance and feature addition to the aforementioned systems (frontend excluded).

## Timeline

My first encounter with Cosmos was 10 months ago when I was busy applying for my current job. Not having worked *professionally* as a developer before they wanted to test my aptitude by performing various tasks, the first being to create a `Cosmos` Blockcchain with a simple `lending` module.

I succesfully passed this task, as well as a few others, and got the job! It's wonderful working in the Blockchain industry as you're always having to adapt and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I've recently worked through another `Cosmos` Blockchain. This time, however, I made use of `Starport` for a lot of the scaffolding of the project. It is a basic implementation of the Checkers game.

As we are all aware, `Cosmos` isn't just comprised of `Starport` & itself, there are also other components such as `Tendermint` as well as `CosmWasm`. Although not having worked to much with `Tendermint` due to so much of it being abstracted as well as being able to use `Cosmos` directly, I have worked with `CosmWasm` and `Rust` a bit whilst fiddling with smart contracts. 

I'm an eager learner and always love a challenge!
